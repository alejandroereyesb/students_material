# 01. VueJS

This section is going to be a little bit different than the others, since there is no documentation at all here in this docs. The reason for that is that we find the official docs so well explained and put together that we thought it would be useless to try to give a quick summary to you. Instead, during these classes, we'll follow along the documentation, giving you small exercises also suggested in the docs. In the end, we'll propose another exercise for you to build reuniting all the features that we're going to teach you from now on.

Remember, that this is the final section of the course and once we finish it, you should start building your application in Vue (besides the exercises you'll do at the end of this section). This would be a good time to start thinking about what kind of problem you want to solve (it can be related to anything you want). Remember that we're here to help you, so if you feel like nothing comes up, feel free to ask us and we'll sure come up with something for you. Enjoy the last ride!
